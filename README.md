# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java!

This is a project for me!

This will be an ongoing collection of problems and solutions I'm working on or have solved.
I'm looking forward to reviewing all the great, and potentially ridiculous, approaches I will have taken, lending study
material and eye rolls for interviews and the like.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

What you need to get started

```
Java!
```
Or, rather, the Java Development Kit (JDK)
I'd recommend the latest version, as of this writing that would be 14
[AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

### Installing


Step 1
```
Figure out step 1
```

Step 2

```
Repeat step 1
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Coming soon!

## Built With

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - My prefered IDE
